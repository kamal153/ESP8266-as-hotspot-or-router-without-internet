# ESP8266-as-hotspot-or-router-without-internet
In most of our ESP8266 NodeMCU web server projects, we connect the ESP8266 to a wireless router. In this configuration, we can access the ESP8266 through the local network.  In this scenario, the router acts as an access point and the ESP8266 is set as a station. So, you need to be connected to your router (local network) to control the ESP8266.
